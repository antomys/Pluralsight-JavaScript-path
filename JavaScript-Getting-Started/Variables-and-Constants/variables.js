// let let's us to declare a variable
let total = 149.99;  // as float
let product = 'Harry Potter book';  //as string
let booleanExpression = true;  //as boolean

// For naming we can use ANYTHING except keywords

// Valid variable names:
// Starts with One of: _ $ letter
let _variable = 4;
let $variable = 5;
let variable = 6;
let __proto__ = 4;
// What starts with __ is probably reserved for something

// Usually variable that starts with _ is private.
// in c# private readonly string _variable; so in js: let $variable = 4;
// Usually variable that starts with $ indicates automatically generated variable

// Followeb by Zero or More: _ $ letter number

// CAN NOT START FROM NUMBER AS IN C#

// Constants:
// In Js we can set constants as: 
const price = 400;
//Then we can't change it!
